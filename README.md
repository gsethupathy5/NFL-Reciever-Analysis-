# Fantasy Football Wide Reciever Analysis
Fantasy Football is a large hobby that millions of Americans take part in every year. In this project we wanted to see what NFL wide receivers are going to perform the best the upcoming season. We did this by running a variety of different models. Not to mention, it is important to plan for the upcoming season, so we used some clustering models to help us see what low ranked players have the same attributes to highly ranked players.
